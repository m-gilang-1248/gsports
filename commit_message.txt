feat: Finalize Core Config (Theme, Router, Placeholder Pages)

- Created placeholder pages: SplashPage, LoginPage, HomePage, BookingPage.
- Implemented `CardThemeData`, `ElevatedButtonTheme`, `OutlinedButtonTheme`, and `InputDecorationTheme` in `lib/core/config/theme.dart` matching UI/UX spec.
- Corrected `CardTheme` to `CardThemeData` type.
- Configured `GoRouter` with initial routes (`/`, `/login`, `/home`, `/booking`) using the new placeholder pages.
- Updated `MODIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` journal and checked off completed tasks.
- Ran `dart fix`, `analyze_files`, and `dart format` with no errors.
